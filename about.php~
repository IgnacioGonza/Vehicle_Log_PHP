<h2>Project Purpose</h2>
<p>Vehicle Log is a maintenance management program for one of more automobiles or trucks. 
Almost everyone has a vehicle that requires everything from gasoline to costly maintenance 
repairs. Vehicle Log is designed to track the use and cost of all consumables as well as 
machine maintenance. It will calculate the cost to operate a vehicle over a period of time. It will 
help the user watch everything from how many miles per gallon they are getting to how many 
miles a set of tires lasts. Vehicle Log can work for one vehicle or a whole fleet.
